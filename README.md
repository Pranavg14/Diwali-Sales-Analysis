🧠 Project Overview

1. During the festive Diwali season, consumer purchasing behavior often varies across demographics and product categories. This project uses real sales data to:
2. Clean and preprocess the dataset
3. Perform exploratory analysis to understand trends
4. Visualize insights that can guide business decisions
5. Identify key customer segments and top-performing products
Insights from the analysis can help improve sales strategy, inventory planning, and targeted marketing. 

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains sales transactions from the Diwali festival period and typically includes - Customer demographics (gender, age group, marital status), Product and category details, State / region of purchase, Sales amount and order counts (Adjust column names based on your exact dataset) 

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

This project utilizes:
Python – programming language
Jupyter Notebook – interactive coding environment
Pandas – data manipulation
NumPy – numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualizations
Git & GitHub – version control

These tools help perform data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization effectively. 

🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing - Handling missing values and ensuring consistency.
Customer Demographics Exploration - Patterns across gender, age groups, and states.
Sales Trend Visualization - Visual insight into high-performing product categories and sales regions.
Product & Category Insights - Identify top-selling categories and products during Diwali.
Segment Insights - Understand which segments (age/gender/occupation) drive the highest sales. 

📈 Key Insights (Typical Findings)

1. Majority of buyers often fall into the 26–35 age group
2. Certain states show higher overall sales
3. Female customers may contribute significantly to total purchases
4. Top categories often include Clothing & Apparel, Electronics, and Food items
